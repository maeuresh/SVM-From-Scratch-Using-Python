# SVM-From-Scratch-Using-Python

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) from scratch using Python and NumPy. SVM is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The goal of SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in the data by maximizing the margin between the classes.
